## Dataset

A TVSum dataset (downsampled to 320 frames per video) preprocessed by `make_dataset.py` is available [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1BZyUAosqOQeSRhP0HCezC01bwc7A-nJp). There are 50 groups in this hdf5 file named `video_1` to `video_50` . Datasets in each group is as follows:

| name  | description |
| :-------: | :----------------------------: |
| `length`  | scalar, number of video frames |
| `feature` |       shape (320, 1024)        |
|  `label`  |          shape (320, )          |
| `change_points` | shape (n_segments, 2) <br>stores begin and end of each segment |
| `n_frame_per_seg` | shape (n_segments) <br>number of frames in each segment |
| `user_summary` | shape (20, length) <br>summary from 20 users, each row is a binary vector |

## Train

First change the `data_path` in `config.py` to your own hdf5 data path. Then run

```shell
python train.py
```

Every 5 epoch, model parameters and predicted summaries will be saved in save_dir and score_dir respectively. Evaluation result (precision, recall and f-score) will be printed at the same time.

## Generate Summary

To generate keyframes (images) and keyshots (video), run

```shell
python gen_summary.py --h5_path {your hdf5 dataset path} --json_path {json file path saved in score_dir} --data_root {root dir of tvsum dataset} --save_dir {where to save the generating summary} --bar
```

## Problems

When training on SumMe dataset made by `make_dataset.py`, the evaluation result is quite terrible. However, the same methods seems to be good on TVSum. Some problems still exists in my code, I would be grateful if you could find them out :)
